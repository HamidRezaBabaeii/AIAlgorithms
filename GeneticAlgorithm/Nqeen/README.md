## Genetic Algorithm for solving N-Queen problem

#This project has 5 parameters:

    1- the first is number of population.
    2- the second is number of Queens.
    3- the number of Generation that Algorithm will have generated. 
    4- the Team size
    5- the Elite rate
    6- the Mutation rate

I have used Tournament approach and Cross Over Poin in this algorithm.
